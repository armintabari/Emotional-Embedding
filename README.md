# Emotional Embedding

This is the code used in the paper: "Emotional Embeddings: Refining Word Embeddings to Capture Emotional Content of Words" designed to incorporate emotional constraint into pre-trained word embeddings.

# How to run
After downloading/cloning the code, put the pre-trained vectors file in "./vectors/" and run the embedding.py. it requires numpy to be installed.

$python embedding.py
